 #  Pavement Distress Detection using Deep Learning  

##  Project Description  
This project focuses on **automatic detection of pavement distresses** such as **cracks, potholes, and surface wear** from road surface images. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and error-prone, whereas this project applies **deep learning (CNNs and transfer learning)** to provide a faster and more reliable solution. The workflow involves preprocessing of pavement images, model training, evaluation, and prediction. The system can be further extended for real-time deployment in **road survey vehicles, drones, or mobile applications**, making it useful for **smart infrastructure management**.
